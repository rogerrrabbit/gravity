Hi!

So, this this a very early version of a prototype of a game of mine.
Please use with caution.

It needs Java, so, if do not have it yet, please install a Java Runtime Environment;
https://www.java.com/fr/

Once you have Java, you extract all the stuff from this archive to ... where you want.

You run "gravity.jar"!

And basically, you have to choose between some game modes (arrow keys or directions on the gamepad),
then validate (using some "Enter" or "Start" buttons).

Notes:

(1) the game runs fullscreen, and it loves 1920*1080 screen res.

(2) the following keyboard strikes helps a bit:
-- Esc: leave the game,
-- Home: go back to start screen,
-- N: switch vehicule (in the "Sandbox" game),
-- P: pause/unpause the game,
-- +/-: zoom in or out (in some games only),
-- PageUp/PageDown: change game speed,
-- C: toggle collisions on/off,
-- G: toggle gravity on/off.

(3) there is some basic usage of the Mouse too:
-- Left click: you make appear a new vehicule for "Player 1",
-- Right click: you make appear a new vehicule for "Player 2".

(4) the game should work with any controller or game pad, and:
- it was tested with: Xbox360-compatible pad, SNES-like pad, standard Joystick,
- it was NOT tested with anything else ;-),
- the "SELECT" buttons of most gamepads is mapped to the "Esc" key behavior,
- the "START" button reloads the current game,
- the D-Pad or Stick handles vehicule movement,
- there should be at least two different "attack" buttons (two weapons),
  up to you to find the buttons on the game pad!

(5) about players controls:
If there's one gamepad connected to the system, then it controls "Player 1",
else, the next gamepad detected by the system controls "Player 2",

(6) you can use keyboard too:
- "Player 1" uses "Up/Down/Left/Right" to move,
   and the "*" and "/" keys from the Numeric Pad to fire things,
- "Player 2" uses "ZQSD" to move,
   and the "E" and "R" keys to fire things.

Please enjoy give feedback !!
